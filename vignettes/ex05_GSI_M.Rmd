In this vignette we walk through an example using the `wham` (WHAM = Woods Hole Assessment Model) package to run a state-space age-structured stock assessment model. WHAM is a generalization of code written for [Miller et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0339) and [Xu et al. (2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/fog.12236), and in this example we apply WHAM to the same stock, Southern New England / Mid-Atlantic Yellowtail Flounder. 

This is the 5th WHAM example, which builds off [example 2](https://timjmiller.github.io/wham/articles/ex2_CPI_recruitment.html) (also available as an [R script](is available as a [R script](https://github.com/timjmiller/wham/blob/master/inst/example_scripts/ex2_CPI_recruitment.R) ) :

- full state-space model (numbers-at-age are random effects for all ages, `NAA_re = list(sigma='rec+1',cor='iid')`)
- logistic normal age compositions, pooling zero observations with adjacent ages (`age_comp = "logistic-normal-pool0"`)
- random-about-mean recruitment (`recruit_model = 2`)
- 5 indices
- fit to 1973-2011 data

We assume you already have `wham` installed. If not, see the [Introduction](https://timjmiller.github.io/wham/). The simpler 1st example, without environmental effects or time-varying $M$, is available as a [R script](https://github.com/timjmiller/wham/blob/master/inst/example_scripts/ex1_basics.R) and [vignette](https://timjmiller.github.io/wham/articles/ex1_basics.html).

In example 5, we demonstrate how to specify and run WHAM with the following options for natural mortality:

- not estimated (fixed at input values)
- one value, $M$
- age-specific, $M_a$ (independent)
- function of weight-at-age, $M_{y,a} = \mu_M * W_{y,a}^b$
- AR1 deviations by age (random effects), $M_{y,a} = \mu_M + \delta_a \quad\mathrm{and}\quad \delta_a \sim \mathcal{N} (\rho_a \delta_{a-1}, \sigma^2_M)$
- AR1 deviations by year (random effects), $M_{y,a} = \mu_M + \delta_y \quad\mathrm{and}\quad \delta_y \sim \mathcal{N} (\rho_y \delta_{y-1}, \sigma^2_M)$
- 2D AR1 deviations by age and year (random effects), $M_{y,a} = M_a + \delta_{y,a} \quad\mathrm{and}\quad \delta_{y,a} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)$

We also demonstrate alternate specifications for the link between $M$ and an environmental covariate, the Gulf Stream Index (GSI), as in [O'Leary et al. (2019)](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2018-0092):

- none
- linear (in log-space), $M_{y,a} = e^{\mathrm{log}\mu_M + \beta_1 E_y}$
- quadratic (in log-space), $M_{y,a} = e^{\mathrm{log}\mu_M + \beta_1 E_y + \beta_2 E^2_y}$

Note that you can specify more than one of the above effects on $M$, although the model may not be estimable. For example, the most complex model with weight-at-age, 2D AR1 age- and year-deviations, and a quadratic environmental effect: $M_{y,a} = e^{\mathrm{log}\mu_M + b W_{y,a} + \beta_1 E_y + \beta_2 E^2_y + \delta_{y,a}}$.

## 1. Load data

Open R and load `wham` and other useful packages:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(wham)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(viridis)
```

For a clean, runnable `.R` script, look at `ex5_M_GSI.R` in the `example_scripts` folder of the `wham` package.
You can run this entire example script with:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
wham.dir <- find.package("wham")
source(file.path(wham.dir, "example_scripts", "ex5_M_GSI.R"))
```

Let's create a directory for this analysis:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# choose a location to save output, otherwise will be saved in working directory
write.dir <- "choose/where/to/save/output" # need to change e.g., tempdir(check=TRUE)
dir.create(write.dir)
setwd(write.dir)
```

We need the same ASAP data file as in [example 2](https://timjmiller.github.io/wham/articles/ex2_CPI_recruitment.html), and the environmental covariate (Gulf Stream Index, GSI). Read in `ex2_SNEMAYT.dat` and `GSI.csv`:
```{r eval=FALSE}
asap3 <- read_asap3_dat(file.path(wham.dir,"extdata","ex2_SNEMAYT.dat"))
env.dat <- read.csv(file.path(wham.dir,"extdata","GSI.csv"), header=T)
head(env.dat)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
#asap3 <- read_asap3_dat(file.path(system.file("extdata", package="wham"),"ex2_SNEMAYT.dat"))
env.dat <- read.csv(file.path(system.file("extdata", package="wham"),"GSI.csv"), header=T)
head(env.dat)
```

The GSI does not have a standard error estimate, either for each yearly observation or one overall value. In such a case, WHAM can estimate the observation error for the environmental covariate, either as one overall value, $\sigma_E$, or yearly values as random effects, $\mathrm{log}\sigma_{E_y} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathrm{log}\sigma_E, \sigma^2_{\sigma_E})$. In this example we choose the simpler option and estimate one observation error parameter, shared across years.

## 2. Specify models

Now we specify 14 models with different options for natural mortality:
```{r}
Ecov_how <- paste0(
  c("none",rep("",2), rep("none", 9), rep("", 2)),
  c("", rep("lag-0-",2), rep("",9), rep("lag-0-",2)),
  c("", "linear", "poly-2", rep("",9), "linear", "poly-2"))

mean_model <- c(rep("fixed-M",6), "estimate-M", "weight-at-age", rep("estimate-M",6))
age_specific <- c(rep(NA,6),TRUE, NA, rep(FALSE, 6))

df.mods <- data.frame(M_model = c(rep("---",6),"age-specific","weight-at-age",rep("constant",6)),
                      mean_model = mean_model,
                      age_specific = age_specific,
                      M_re = c(rep("none",3),"ar1_a","ar1_y","ar1_ay",rep("none",3),"ar1_a", "ar1_y",rep("ar1_ay",3)),
                      Ecov_process = rep("ar1",14),
                      Ecov_how = Ecov_how, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
n.mods <- dim(df.mods)[1]
df.mods$Model <- paste0("m",1:n.mods)
df.mods <- df.mods |> select(Model, everything()) # moves Model to first col
```

Look at the model table:
```{r}
df.mods
```
The first 6 models fix mean natural mortality rates. Some of these models assume age and or year varying random effects or effects of GSI on M. Model 7 estimates age-specific M as fixed effects and Model 8 estimates M as a function of weight at age. Models 9-14 make similar assumptions to models 1-6, but a constant mean M parameter (across age and time) is estimated.

## 3. Natural mortality options

We specify the options for modeling natural mortality by including an optional list argument, `M`, to the  `prepare_wham_input()` function (see the `prepare_wham_input()` and `set_M()` help pages). `M` specifies estimation options and can overwrite M-at-age values specified in the ASAP data file. By default (i.e. `M` is `NULL` or not included), the M-at-age matrix from the ASAP data file is used (M fixed, not estimated). `M` is a list that includes following entries relevant here:

- `$mean_model`: Natural mortality model options.

  - `"constant"`: estimate a single $M$, shared across all ages and years.
  - `"age-specific"`: estimate $M_a$ independent for each age, shared across years.
  - `"weight-at-age"`: estimate $M$ as a function of weight-at-age, $M_{y,a} = \mu_M * W_{y,a}^b$, as in [Lorenzen (1996)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1996.tb00060.x) and [Miller & Hyun (2018)](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2017-0035).

- `$re_model`: Time- and age-varying random effects on $M$.

  - `"none"`: $M$ constant in time and across ages (default).
  - `"iid_a"`: $M$ varies by age, but uncorrelated and constant over years.
  - `"iid_y"`: $M$ varies by year, but uncorrelated and constant over age.
  - `"iid_ay"`: $M$ varies by year and age, but uncorrelated.
  - `"ar1_a"`: $M$ correlated by age (AR1), constant in time.
  - `"ar1_y"`: $M$ correlated by year (AR1), constant by age.
  - `"ar1_ay"`: $M$ correlated by year and age (2D AR1), as in [Cadigan (2016)](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0047).

- `$initial_means`: an array of initial/mean  M parameters  (n_stocks x n_regions x n_ages). If `NULL`, initial mean M-at-age values are taken from the first row of the MAA matrix in the ASAP data file(s).

- `$means_map`: an array of integers (n_stocks x n_regions x n_ages) of that distinguishes which mean parameters to estimate and whether any should have the same value. In all models we have 1 stock and 1 region and 6 ages. So to estimate different M for each age we set: `$means_map = array(1:6, dim = c(1,1,6))`. If `NULL`, $M$ at all ages is fixed at `M$initial_means` (if not `NULL`) or row 1 of the MAA matrix from the ASAP file(s) (if `M$initial_means = NULL`).

For example, to fit model `m1`, fix $M_a$ at values in ASAP file:

```{r eval=FALSE}
M <- NULL # or simply leave out of call to prepare_wham_input
```

To fit model `m9`, estimate one $M$, constant by year and age:

```{r eval=FALSE}
M <- list(mean_model="estimate-M", means_map = array(1,dim = c(1,1,6)))
```

To fit model `m12` where we estimate a mean $M$ parameter and 2DAR1 deviations by year and age:

```{r eval=FALSE}
M <- list(model="estimate-M", means_map = array(1, dim = c(1,1,asap3[[1]]$dat$n_ages)), re_model="ar1_ay")
```

To fit model `m11`, use the $M_a$ values specified in the ASAP file, but with 2D AR1 deviations as in [Cadigan (2016)](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0047):

```{r eval=FALSE}
M <- list(re_model=matrix("ar1_ay",1,1))
```

## 4. Linking *M* to an environmental covariate (GSI)

As described in [example 2](https://timjmiller.github.io/wham/articles/ex2_CPI_recruitment.html), the environmental covariate options are fed to `prepare_wham_input()` as a list, `ecov`. This example differs from example 2 in that:

- We will estimate the observation error for the GSI (one overall value for all years): `$logsigma = "est_1"`. The other option is `"est_re"` to allow the GSI observation error to have yearly fluctuations (random effects). The Cold Pool Index in example 2 had yearly observation errors given.
- We will assume GSI affects $M$ rather than recruitment.
- We will assume a lag of 0 for the effect of GSI on $M$: GSI in year *t* affects $M$ in year *t*, instead of year *t+1*.
- We will consider models with and without the effect of GSI on $M$, but keep the state-space model for GSI in the model to allow AIC comparisons.
- We will consider both linear and quadratic effects of GSI on $M$. WHAM includes a function to calculate orthogonal polynomials in TMB, akin to the [`poly()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/poly) function in R.

For example, the `ecov` list for model `m3` with a quadratic GSI-M effect:

```{r eval=FALSE}
  # example for model m3
  ecov <- list(
    label = "GSI",
    mean = as.matrix(env.dat$GSI),
    logsigma = 'est_1', # estimate obs sigma, 1 value shared across years
    year = env.dat$year,
    use_obs = matrix(1, ncol=1, nrow=dim(env.dat)[1]), # use all obs (=1)
    lag = 0, # GSI in year t affects M in same year
    process_model = "ar1", # GSI modeled as AR1 (random walk would be "rw")
    M_how = array("lag-0-poly-2",c(1,1,6,1))) # n_Ecov x n_stocks x n_ages x n_regions
```

Note that you can set `ecov = NULL` to fit the model without environmental covariate data, but here we fit the `ecov` data even for models without GSI effect on $M$ (`m1`, `m4-12`) so that we can compare them via AIC (need to have the same data in the likelihood). We accomplish this by setting `ecov$M_how = array("none",c(1,1,6,1))` and `ecov$process_model = "ar1"`.

## 5. Run all models

All models use the same options for recruitment (random-about-mean, no stock-recruit function) and selectivity (logistic, with parameters fixed for indices 4 and 5).

```{r eval=FALSE}
mods <- list()
for(m in 1:n.mods){
  ecov <- list(
    label = "GSI",
    mean = as.matrix(env.dat$GSI),
    logsigma = 'est_1', # estimate obs sigma, 1 value shared across years
    year = env.dat$year,
    use_obs = matrix(1, ncol=1, nrow=dim(env.dat)[1]), # use all obs (=1)
    process_model = df.mods$Ecov_process[m], # "rw" or "ar1"
    M_how = array(df.mods$Ecov_how[m],c(1,1,asap3[[1]]$dat$n_ages,1))) # n_Ecov x n_stocks x n_ages x n_regions

  mean_map <- NULL
  if(df.mods$mean_model[m] == "estimate-M"){
    if(df.mods$age_specific[m]) mean_map[1,1,] <- 1:asap3[[1]]$dat$n_ages
    else mean_map[1,1,] <- 1
  }
  M <- list(
    mean_model = df.mods$mean_model[m],
    re_model = matrix(df.mods$M_re[m], 1,1),
    means_map = mean_map
  )
  if(df.mods$mean_model[m] == "estimate-M" & !df.mods$age_specific[m]) M$initial_means = array(0.28, c(1,1,asap3[[1]]$dat$n_ages)) #n_stocks x n_regions x n_ages

  input <- prepare_wham_input(asap3, recruit_model = 2,
    model_name = paste0("m",m,": ", df.mods$mean_model[m]," + GSI link: ",df.mods$Ecov_how[m]," + M RE: ", df.mods$M_re[m]),
    ecov = ecov,
    selectivity=list(model=rep("logistic",6),
      initial_pars=c(rep(list(c(3,3)),4), list(c(1.5,0.1), c(1.5,0.1))),
      fix_pars=c(rep(list(NULL),4), list(1:2, 1:2))),
    NAA_re = list(sigma='rec+1',cor='iid'),
    M=M,
    age_comp = "logistic-normal-pool0")

  # Fit model
  mods[[m]] <- fit_wham(input, do.retro=T, do.osa=F) # turn off OSA residuals to save time

  # Save model
  saveRDS(mod[[m]], file=paste0(df.mods$Model[m],".rds"))

  # If desired, plot output in new subfolder
  # plot_wham_output(mod=mod, dir.main=file.path(getwd(),df.mods$Model[m]), out.type='html')
  
  # If desired, do projections
  # mod_proj <- project_wham(mod)
  # saveRDS(mod_proj, file=paste0(df.mods$Model[m],"_proj.rds"))
}
```

## 6. Compare models

```{r include=FALSE}
#data(vign5_res) #not necessary
# data(vign5_MAA)
```

Get model convergence and stats.

```{r eval=FALSE}
opt_conv = 1-sapply(mods, function(x) x$opt$convergence)
ok_sdrep = sapply(mods, function(x) if(x$na_sdrep==FALSE & !is.na(x$na_sdrep)) 1 else 0)
df.mods$conv <- as.logical(opt_conv)
df.mods$pdHess <- as.logical(ok_sdrep)
```

Only calculate AIC and Mohn's rho for converged models.

```{r eval=FALSE}
df.mods$runtime <- sapply(mods, function(x) x$runtime)
df.mods$NLL <- sapply(mods, function(x) round(x$opt$objective,3))
is_conv <- df.mods$conv & df.mods$pdHess
which(is_conv) # 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12
mods2 <- mods[is_conv]
#mods2[not_conv] <- NULL
df.aic.tmp <- as.data.frame(compare_wham_models(mods2, table.opts=list(sort=FALSE, calc.rho=TRUE))$tab)
df.aic <- df.aic.tmp[FALSE,]
ct = 1
for(i in 1:n.mods){
  if(!is_conv[i]){
    df.aic[i,] <- rep(NA,5)
  } else {
    df.aic[i,] <- df.aic.tmp[ct,]
    ct <- ct + 1
  }
}
df.aic[,1:2] <- format(round(df.aic[,1:2], 1), nsmall=1)
df.aic[,3:5] <- format(round(df.aic[,3:5], 3), nsmall=3)
df.aic[grep("NA",df.aic$dAIC),] <- "---"
df.mods <- cbind(df.mods, df.aic)
rownames(df.mods) <- NULL
```

Look at results table.

```{r eval=FALSE}
df.mods
```

## 7. Results

In the table, we have highlighted in gray models which converged and successfully inverted the Hessian to produce SE estimates for all (fixed effect) parameters. WHAM stores this information in `mod$na_sdrep` (should be `FALSE`), `mod$sdrep$pdHess` (should be `TRUE`), and `mod$opt$convergence` (should be `0`). See `stats::nlminb()` and `TMB::sdreport()` for details.

Model `m12` (estimate mean $M$ and 2D AR1 deviations by year and age, no GSI effect) had the lowest AIC among converged models and was overwhelmingly supported relative to the other models (**bold** in table below). The retrospective patterns in SSB and $F$ were also negligble compared to other models as measured by Mohn's $\rho$.

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
# vign5_res[,12:14] = round(vign5_res[,12:14], 3)

#### Estimated *M*

- Models allowed to estimate mean $M$ increased $M$ (`m7-m14`) compared to the fixed values in models `m1-m6` (more green/yellow than blue).
- Models that estimated $M_a$ (`m4`, `m7`, `m10`) had highest $M_a$ for ages 4-5.
- Models that estimated $M_y$ (`m5` and `m11`) had higher $M_y$ in the early 1990s and early 2000s.
- Models with GSI effects and random effects deviations in M did not converge.



Model `m6` left $M_a$ fixed at the values from the ASAP data file (as in `m1`) and estimated 2D AR1 deviations around these mean $M_a$, but this model did not converge. This is how $M$ was modeled in [Cadigan (2016)](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0047). Model `m8` that assumed M as a function of weight at age estimated essentially no effect so that M was constant and a negative log likelihood essentially the same as model `m9` that made the simpler assumption of a constant M estimated. Below is a plot of $M$ by age (y-axis) and year (x-axis) for all models. Models with a positive definite Hessian are solid, and models with non-positive definite Hessian are pale.

#### Retrospective patterns

Compared to `m1`, the retrospective pattern for `m12` was slightly worse for recruitment (`m12` 0.31, `m1` 0.26) but improved for SSB (`m8` 0.01, `m1` 0.11) and F (`m8` -0.04, `m1` -0.15). Compare the retrospective patterns of numbers-at-age, SSB, and F for models `m1` (left, fixed $M_a$) and `m12` (right, estimated $M$ + 2D AR1 deviations).

#### Stock status

Compared to `m1` (left), `m12` (right) estimated SPR-based reference points were more uncertain due to estimation of M rather than an assumed value. Model `m12` estimates of $F_{40\%SPR}$ (middle) and yield at $F_{40\%SPR}$ (top) were higher, whereas estimates of SSB at $F_{40\%SPR}$ were generally lower. 

![Reference point variability, m1.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timjmiller/wham/master/vignettes/ex5_plots/m1_FSPR_annual_time.png){ width=45% }![Reference point variability, m12.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timjmiller/wham/master/vignettes/ex5_plots/m12_FSPR_annual_time.png){ width=45% }

Compared to `m1` (left), `m12` (right) estimated higher *M* and higher SSB -- a much rosier picture of the stock status through time.

In the final year (2011), `m12` estimated much lower probabilities of the stock being overfished than `m1` (1% vs. 93%).

### Yet more *M* options

If you want to estimate M-at-age shared/mirrored among *some but not all ages*, you can modify `M$means_map`.
