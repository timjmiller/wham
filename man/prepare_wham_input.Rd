\description{
Prepares data and parameter settings for  \code{\link{fit_wham}}, optionally using an ASAP3 data file read into R by \code{\link{read_asap3_dat}}.
By default, this will set up a SCAA version like \href{https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/nft/ASAP.html}{ASAP} without any penalties or random effects.
If any asap3, basic_info, catch_info, and index_info arguments are not provided, some respective arbitrary
assumptions are made. The various options described below, such as \code{NAA_re} and \code{selectivity},
can still be used without the asap3 object.
}
\details{
\code{recruit_model} specifies the stock-recruit model. See \code{wham.cpp} for implementation.
  \describe{
    \item{= 1}{SCAA (without NAA_re option specified) or Random walk (if NAA_re$sigma specified), i.e. predicted recruitment in year i = recruitment in year i-1}
    \item{= 2}{(default) Random effects about constant mean}
    \item{= 3}{Beverton-Holt}
    \item{= 4}{Ricker}
  }
Note: \code{\link{fit_wham}} allows fitting a SCAA model (\code{NAA_re = NULL}), which estimates recruitment in every year as separate fixed effect parameters,
but in that case no stock-recruit function is estimated. A warning message is printed if \code{recruit_model > 2} and \code{NAA_re = NULL}.
If you wish to use a stock-recruit function for expected recruitment, choose recruitment deviations as random effects,
either only age-1 (\code{NAA_re = list(sigma="rec")}) or all ages (\code{NAA_re = list(sigma="rec+1")}, "full state-space" model).
See below for details on \code{NAA_re} specification.

\code{ecov} specifies any environmental covariate data and models. See \code{\link{set_ecov}} for full details. 

\code{selectivity} specifies options for selectivity, to overwrite existing options specified in the ASAP data file. See \code{\link{set_selectivity}} for full details. 

\code{M} specifies estimation options for natural mortality and can overwrite M-at-age values specified in the ASAP data file. See \code{\link{set_M}} for full details. 

\code{NAA_re} specifies options for random effects on numbers-at-age (NAA, i.e. state-space model or not). See \code{\link{set_NAA}} for full details. 
If \code{NULL}, a traditional statistical catch-at-age model is fit.

\code{catchability} specifies options for catchability. See \code{\link{set_q}} for full details. If \code{NULL} and \code{asap3} is not NULL, a single catchability parameter for each index is used with initial values specified in ASAP file. If both are NULL, initial catchabilities for all indices = 0.3.

\code{move} specifies options for movement if there are multiple regions. See \code{\link{set_move}} for full details. 

\code{age_comp} specifies the age composition models for fleet(s) and indices. See \code{\link{set_age_comp}} for full details. 

\code{catch_info} is an optional list of fishery catch information that can be used to set up these types of observations when there is no asap3 file given.  See \code{\link{set_catch}} for full details. Useful for setting
up an operating model to simulate population processes and observations. Also can be useful for setting up the structure of assessment model when asap3 has not been used.

\code{index_info} is an optional list of survey/index information that can be used to set up these types of observations when there is no asap3 file given.  See \code{\link{set_indices}} for full details. Useful for setting
up an operating model to simulate population processes and observations. Also can be useful for setting up the structure of assessment model when asap3 has not been used.

\code{basic_info} is an optional list of information that can be used to set up the population and types of observations when there is no asap3 file given. Particularly useful for setting
up an operating model to simulate population processes and observations. Also can be useful for setting up the structure of assessment model when asap3 has not been used.

If other arguments to \code{prepare_wham_input} are provided such as \code{selectivity}, \code{M}, and \code{age_comp}, the information provided there
must be consistent with \code{basic_info}. For example the dimensions for number of years, ages, fleets, and indices.
